It boasts the highest per-day productivity among crops and holds the distinction of being one of the earliest cultivated plants in history (Sardar, 2016). In the Philippines, corn assumes a pivotal role in attaining food self-sufficiency, occupying the second most important position among crops (Gargasin, 2018). A significant proportion, amounting to one-third, of Filipino farmers heavily rely on corn as their principal means of livelihood (Biñas, 2021). Given the substantial reliance of numerous farmers on corn production, gaining insights into its viability is of paramount importance.',
